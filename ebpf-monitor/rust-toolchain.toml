# Pin Rust nightly toolchain for eBPF compilation.
#
# We use `rust-src` (NOT `targets = ["bpfel-unknown-none"]`) because:
#   - aya-rs compiles core from source via `-Z build-std=core`
#   - The pre-built `rust-std-bpfel-unknown-none` is frequently missing
#     from nightly distributions, causing toolchain install failures
#     that waste CI minutes walking back through dozens of nightlies.
